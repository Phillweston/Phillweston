# Phillweston: A Journey in Electronic Information Engineering & Beyond

üëã **Welcome to My Space!** I'm Phillweston.

üè´ **Academic Background:** Proud alumnus of Xidian University, where I honed my skills and earned a Bachelor's degree in Electronic Information Engineering.

üëÄ **Passions & Interests:** My academic and professional journey is driven by a deep fascination with Control Theory and Aircraft Navigation & Decision Systems.

üå± **Research & Innovation:** As part of my undergraduate capstone project, I delved into the realm of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). My research focused on Autonomous Waypoint Flight and developing a cutting-edge Dual-Photothermal Imaging Target Detection Algorithm.

üîß **My Recent Projects:** I'm currently working on a series of projects that explore the intersection of Blockchain Technology and AI-based Failure Detection Systems for Hard Drives.
